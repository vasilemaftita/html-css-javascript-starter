  <h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
  <p>Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible.</p>
  <p>If you need a button, use the button element and not a div element:</p>
  
  <button>Click Me</button>

  <div>Click Me</div>

  <p>A button element has more suitable styling than a div, and it is clickable by default.</p>
