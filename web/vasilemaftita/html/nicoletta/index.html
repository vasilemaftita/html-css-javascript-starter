    <h1>"Why asian food is the best"</h1>
    <h2>
      Asian food is notorious for ruining everything good and easy in your life.
      After one bite, you’ll soon realise that all other dishes are bland and
      stodgy in comparison, and you’ll have to hunt and gather for ace Asian
      restaurants for the rest of your days.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Asian food is the best food out of all the nationalities. It’s quite a
      statement, but it’s one that I stand by! Sure, I might be a touch biased
      since I am half Asian, but I prefer to call myself ‘well-educated’ instead
      of biased.
    </h3>

      <b>
        I have been lucky enough to sample a huge range of dishes from various
        restaurants, cafes, street vendors and home-cooking (thanks relatives!)
        from all around the world, and it has solidified my belief that Asian
        food is the way forward to a long, healthy life of tasty treats. Just
        take a look at my grandma – Asian food consumer, 86, doesn’t look a day
        over 60 and still gets caught speeding in her car! What a legend.</b

        As long as you avoid the heavily deep fried dishes, the majority of
        Asian food is simple and pure. From simple rice dishes to flash-fried
        veggies, from noodle soup to seaweed; the list is endless of all the
        varieties you can indulge in! Don’t just reach for the greasy sweet and
        sour chicken or egg fried rice. Think outside the box and you won’t have
        to worry about your waistline with all the sea food, crunchy vegetables
        and nutritious broths.</b

        Vietnamese food is so simple, yet delicious. Have you tried Pho? Have
        you tried rice paper Vietnamese spring rolls? These dishes are stocked
        full of healthy ingredients with minimal messing around in the cooking
        process.</b
